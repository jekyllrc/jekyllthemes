jekyll-backbone
===============

Some boilerplate for creating a Jekyll site with Backbonejs and Requirejs.

You’ll need to have node installed so you can run grunt. After cloning the repository, run these at the command line:

    npm install

and then..

    bower install

For throwing up a development server, run this:

    grunt server

And then when you want a distribution build, run this:

    grunt build

You’ll get your finished static site in `dist/`.
