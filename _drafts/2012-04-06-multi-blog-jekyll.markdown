##Introduction##

This is my (very small) contribution to Jekyll.

I know a lot of people already know how to run a multi blog site using Jekyll, but in case someone do not, I want to share this with that person.

You can read how to use this in my [blog](http://www.garron.me/blog/multi-blog-site-jekyll.html)

Thanks.
