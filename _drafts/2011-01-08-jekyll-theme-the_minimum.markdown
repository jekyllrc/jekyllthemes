## This repo has moved!

Whoever watched/forked this repo, first I like to say thank you, but this repo has moved.

I've decided to use [Jekyll Bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) to create themes for Jekyll.  
New themes or improvment will be done Jekyll Bootstrap repo.
I do have a forked repo, but I really encourage to watch or fork Jekyll Bootstarp repo.

Sorry for the inconvinient, but this is for the best, I think.
