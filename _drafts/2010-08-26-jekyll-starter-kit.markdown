# Jekyll Starter Kit

A starter kit for static sites and blogs. Uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) to generate the site and [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) to make writing CSS more pleasurable.

Includes sensible defaults for Jekyll (smart quotes, pretty URLs) and minimal HTML/CSS/JS starting points.

Start the Jekyll server and watch the Sass/Bourbon files with:

    rake serve
